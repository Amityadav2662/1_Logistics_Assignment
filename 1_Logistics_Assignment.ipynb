    "Ans.\n",
    "The main difference between linear regression and logistic regression lies in their respective purposes and the type of \n",
    "data they handle:\n",
    "1. Linear Regression: Linear regression is used to predict continuous numerical outcomes. It fits a straight line to the\n",
    "data and predicts the value of the dependent variable based on the values of independent variables. For example, \n",
    "predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.\n",
    "2. Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used to predict binary categorical outcomes, such as yes/no, true/false, or \n",
    "presence/absence. It models the probability of an event occurring by fitting a logistic curve to the data. For example, \n",
    "predicting whether a customer will churn (cancel their subscription) based on factors like usage patterns, demographics, \n",
    "and customer service interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate is in predicting whether a patient has a particular\n",
    "disease based on medical test results. The outcome variable (presence or absence of the disease) is binary, and logistic \n",
    "regression can model the probability of disease occurrence based on the values of predictor variables (test results, \n",
    "demographics, etc.)."

    "# Q3. Explain the concept of regularization in logistic regression and how it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Ans.\n",

    "encouraging the model to use simpler, more generalizable patterns instead.\n",
    "By including regularization, logistic regression learns to balance between fitting the training data well and maintaining \n",

    "Ans.\n",
    "The ROC curve, or Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary \n",

    "rate (1 - specificity) for different classification thresholds. The ROC curve helps evaluate the trade-off between sensitivity \n",
    "and specificity, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is used as a summary measure of the model's performance. A higher AUC\n",
    "indicates better discrimination ability of the model, with an AUC of 1 representing a perfect model and an AUC of 0.5 \n",
